       "'The martian stood in the darkness  curiosity , strangely enough . xxbos The bottle struck the floor and broke , and i desisted and rose . xxbos But the poison was scarcely working yet . xxbos With that realisation my interest shifted to those other creatures , the real Martians . xxbos The lightning flashed for a third time , and his face leaped upon me . xxbos The soldiers i addressed did n’t know anything ; they were mysterious as well as busy . xxbos At the place mound an swayed and struck sent the scattered group of people to the gate . xxbos unmistakably that they did not bury any of their dead , and the reckless slaughter they perpetrated , point also to an entire ignorance of the putrefactive process . xxbos Before i went to bed i had an interval of restlessness , and prowled from window to window , peering out for some sign of these monsters . xxbos At first i scarcely noticed the pit and the cylinder , although it has been convenient to describe them first , on account of the extraordinary glittering mechanism i saw busy in the excavation , and on account of the strange creatures that were crawling slowly and painfully across the heaped mould near it . The mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first . xxbos Then i shifted my position to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a yard or more of elevation and when i looked for him presently he was walking towards Woking . The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened . xxbos In the trenches was a tympanic surface , since known to be anatomically an ear , though it must have been almost useless in our dense air . xxbos i stood over him waiting for the next flash . xxbos There presently a lot of shouting , and one man was even jesting . xxbos Suddenly he vanished , and i could have fancied a faint shriek had reached me . xxbos Elphinstone — that was the name of the woman in white — would listen to no reasoning , and kept calling upon “ George ” ; but her sister - in - law was astonishingly quiet and deliberate , and at last agreed to my brother ’s suggestion . xxbos The news that the Martians were now in possession of the whole of London was confirmed . xxbos Now and then came a gap in the lightning , and the night swallowed them up . i was soaked with hail above and puddle water below . xxbos The strangest spectacle , that black expanse set with fire . xxbos There was little i did n’t know . xxbos And but this was a lieutenant and a couple expectation . xxbos There was no flash , no smoke , simply that loaded detonation . i was so excited by these heavy minute - guns following one another that i so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber up into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury . xxbos We saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge box and a score or more of flower pots containing orchids , angrily expostulating with the corporal who would leave them behind . xxbos Being hurried across the exposed bridge , of course , i saw and spared me . xxbos He was dirty and white in the face . My brother turned down towards Victoria , and met a number of such people . xxbos Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit , and the ghost of a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it . Forthwith flashes of actual flame , a bright glare leaping from one to another , sprang from the scattered group of men . xxbos Then i heard quite distinctly a booming exactly like the sound of great guns . xxbos i lit no lamps , fearing some Martian might come beating that part of London for food in the night . xxbos At the sight of eating we went to twilight and stood listening , but towards the window i was shunting on the bushes , and the trampled bushes and broken rose trees outside the window grew distinct . xxbos The Last Man Left Alive ! ” Troubled as they were with their own affairs , these people , whose name , much as i would like to express my gratitude to them , i may not even give here , nevertheless cumbered themselves with me , sheltered me , and protected me from myself . xxbos At last , as the bridge at Walton was coming into sight round the bend , my fever and faintness overcame my fears , and i landed on the Middlesex bank and lay down , deadly sick , amid the long grass . xxbos John ’s Wood and Hampstead , and eastward in Shoreditch and Highbury and Haggerston and Hoxton , and , indeed , through all the vastness of London from Ealing to East Ham — people were rubbing their eyes , and opening windows to stare out and ask aimless questions , dressing hastily as the first breath of the coming storm of Fear blew through the streets . xxbos “ Boilers on stilts , i tell you , striding along like men . ” Most of them were excited and animated by their strange experience . Beyond Victoria the public - houses were doing a lively trade with these arrivals . xxbos “'"
